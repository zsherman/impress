## Instructions

1. Make blog logo your profile picture, should be a .png if possible (TODO, make it work with other file formats).
2. Set blog name to your name, description to your bio. 
3. Your website and email info will appear once there is a single post on the blog, this is just because of the current limitations of ghost right now.
4. Create a new post called projects, make the url '/projects', and check the "static page" option. This will ensure that the projects link on the sidebar works.
